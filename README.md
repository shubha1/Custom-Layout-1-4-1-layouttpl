# Custom-Layout-1-4-1-layouttpl

Here I have developed a custom Layout for a Liferay Page.
It has an additional separate layout for WAP based devices using Rows (no columns) only.

Technologies used to create this Layout plugin:
- Eclipse IDE with Liferay IDE plugin
- Liferay Plugin SDK 6.2
- Java 1.6
- HTML5
- XML
- CSS3
- Twitter Bootstrap 2.3.2 (as supported by Liferay 6.2 using AlloyUI 2.0)

To use it in any Liferay 6.2 portal. 
A war file is being provided. It also includes the source code to work with.
You can install it usting:
- Copy the WAR file to your LiferayPortal6.2 > Deploy Folder while your Liferay 6.2 instance is running.
- Install it using Liferay 6.2 interface: Control Panel > App Manager > Install > File Upload > Choose WAR File and Click Install
